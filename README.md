<b>One Last Note</b>

This application is developed by Mehmet Akif Tütüncü completely independent from <b>Eshot Genel Müdürlüğü</b> and <b>Kent Kart</b>. All the information about busses are downloaded from http://mobil.eshot.gov.tr and all the information about Kent Kart are downloaded from http://m.kentkart.com. As the developer, I do not guarantee that the information is correct and take no responsibility over the usage of the application.

I'd be more than happy if you can let me know about your opinions, suggestions and error reports

Hope it will be useful. :)
